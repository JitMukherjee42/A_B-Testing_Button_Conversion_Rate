# A_B-Testing_Button_Conversion_Rate
This project shows a simple A/B test done in Excel to compare a **Control version** and a **Variant version** of a website button. The goal was to check if the new button design improves the signup rate.
## ✅ What’s inside

- **Raw Data:** Number of visitors and signups for both versions.
- **Analysis:** Calculated conversion rates, uplift, and a Z-test to check if the difference is statistically significant.

## 🧮 Result

- The Variant showed a **1.46% uplift**, but the **Z-score was -1.51**, which is **not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level**.
- This means the result could be due to random chance.

## 🎓 What I learned

- How to perform an A/B test manually in Excel.
- How to calculate conversion rates, uplift, and run a simple Z-test.
- How to interpret statistical significance.
